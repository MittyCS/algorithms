algorithms
==========

This repo contains directories specifying categories of algorithms, each of
which contain directories for specific algorithms. More will be added over time,
but we will start out will sorting and searching algorithms.

The vision of this project is for each participant to write example implementations
of the various algorithms, both for education and practice. 

We will work to write up descriptions (and pseudocode, where applicable) for each 
category and algorithm (found in the appropriate README.md file), but feel free to 
add your own or give suggestions.

There are no restrictions on the language used, so use whatever you prefer.
Java, Python, Ruby, C, C++, PHP, it doesn't matter.

If an algorithm already has an implementation in one language, it is encouraged
to write another implementation in another language.
